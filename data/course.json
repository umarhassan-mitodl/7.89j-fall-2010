Papers covered are selected to illustrate important problems and approaches in the field of computational and systems biology, and provide students a framework from which to evaluate new developments.\n\nThe MIT Initiative in Computational and Systems Biology ({{% resource_link \"7586fb55-7034-407e-b6b0-178c900b1b71\" \"CSBi\" %}}) is a campus-wide research and education program that links biology, engineering, and computer science in a multidisciplinary approach to the systematic analysis and modeling of complex biological phenomena. This course is one of a series of core subjects offered through the CSB Ph.D. program, for students with an interest in interdisciplinary training and research in the area of computational and systems biology.\n",
